  // Core Logic: Promotion and Relegation
  // "After every round move the top player from a group to next higher group"
  // "After every round move the bottom player from a group to next lower group"
  // Note: This logic implies we need match results to know who is "top" of the group for that day.
  // For now, I will simulate this by assuming the "top" player is the one with highest match score gain (or just random/mocked for now if we don't have matches yet).
  // The Prompt says: "a top player from group 3 will move to group 2".

  // Implementation: We actually need to execute this move on the *list* of players ratings or just re-assign them?
  // If the groups are based *strictly* on rating, then updating a player's rating will automatically move them if they cross the threshold.
  // HOWEVER, the prompt implies a structural move: "move the top player... to next higher group".
  // This suggests "Groups" might be stateful for the day, OR we adjust ratings such that they resort correctly?
  // A common league approach is: You play in your group. Based on results, your rating changes OR you specifically swap with the person above/below.
  // Let's implement a `swapPlayers(playerA, playerB)` or `updateRatings` approach.
  // Simpler approach for this task: Update ratings + small boost/penalty to force resort, OR just return the visual "Next Session" groups.
